# Control Flow
## IF
 An if statement defines actions to be performed when a condition is true.

## IF-ELSE
An else statementis used with an if statement and contains a body of statements that is executed when the
 if statement's condition is false. When an if-else statement is executed, one and only one of the branches
 is taken.

## IF-ELIF-ELSE
Chaining decision statements with elif allows the programmer to check for multiple conditions. An elif (short
 for else if) statement checks a condition when the prior decision statement's condition is false. An elif
 statement is part of a chain and must follow an if (or elif) statement

## Nested IFs
A nested if statement in Python is an if statement located within another if or else clause.

# Loops
 A loop is a code block that runs a set of statements while a given condition is true. A loop is often used for
 performing a repeating task.
 
## For Loop
 In Python, a container can be a range of numbers, a string of characters, or a list of values. To access objects
 within a container, an iterative loop can be designed to retrieve objects one at a time. A for loop iterates over
 all elements in a container.

## While Loop
A while loop is a code construct that runs a set of statements, known as the loop body, while a given
 condition, known as the loop expression, is true.

### Continue
skips one step and continues iteration.

### Break
stops the execution of loop and comes out of the loop.
