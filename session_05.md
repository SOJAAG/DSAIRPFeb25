# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
-A field of computer science that studies and develops methods that enables machine to human intelligence and problem solving capabilities.

-applications of AI : 

                      1. advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search)
                      2.recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix)
                      3.virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa)
                      4.autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo)
                      5.generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art)

### DARPA Grand Challenge 2005
-It is a competition for autonomous vehicles.
- the Stanford Racing Team,led by Associate Professor Sebastian Thrun won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge with their autonomous vehicle named Stanley.
  
### ImageNet 2012
-The ImageNet Challenge involves classifying object categories in images from the Internet into one of 1000 possible classes. It serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of deep learning models, particularly deep Convolutional Neural Networks.
- AlexNet (CNN team) won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition challenge 2012.
  
### 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics

John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won Nobel Prize(2024) in Physics. They used tools from physics to construct methods that helped lay the foundation for todayâ€™s powerful machine learning. John Hopfield created a structure that can store and reconstruct information. Geoffrey Hinton invented a method that can independently discover properties in data and which has become important for the large artificial neural networks now in use.  

### Deepseek

-Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., (doing business as DeepSeek) is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that develops large language models (LLMs). 
-it is owned and funded by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. 
-DeepSeek was founded in July 2023 by High-Flyer co-founder Liang Wenfeng.
-The company launched an eponymous chatbot alongside its DeepSeek-R1 model in January 2025.

## Key Deciding Factors of Growth of AI

Progress in artificial intelligence is underpinned by advances in three areas: compute, data, and algorithms.

1.Data Availability and Quality: The availability of large and diverse datasets has been crucial for training advanced AI models by leveraging vast amounts of labeled and unlabeled data, allowing models to learn patterns and relationships effectively.

2.Computational Power: Advances in hardware, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and specialized AI accelerators, have significantly increased the processing power available for training complex AI models.

3.Algorithmic Improvements: Algorithmic progress means that programs can do more computations with a set quantity of computing resources. When AI models can do computations more efficiently, we can train bigger and more capable models, and explore new approaches. This in turn creates new possibilities and risks.

GPU(Graphics Processing Unit): 
-It is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.

-GPUs ability to perform vast numbers of calculations rapidly has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where it excels at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks.

## Correlation Vs. Causation

-Correlation establishes that a relationship exists between two variables, while causation means that one event results in the occurrence of the other event.
-Correlation does not always result in causation.
